"""
Some mistakes are very basic, like choosing a cryptographically-broken algorithm
or committing secret keys directly in your source code.

You are more likely to fall for something more advanced, like using functions that seem random
but produce a weak randomness.

Notice that I used the “random” module, which is designed for modeling and simulation, 
not for security or cryptography.

A good practice is to use modules specifically designed and, most importantly,
confirmed by the security community as secure for cryptography-related use cases.

To fix the code, I used the “secrets” module, which provides access to the most secure source of 
randomness on my operating system. I also used functions for generating secure tokens and hard-to-guess 
URLs. 

Other python modules approved and recommended by the security community include argon2 and pbkdf2.
