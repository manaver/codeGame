Path Traversal vulnerability

A form of injection attacks where attackers escape the intended target
directory and manage to access parent directories.
In the functions get_prof_picture and get_tax_form_attachment, the path
isn't sanitized, and a user can pass invalid paths (with ../).

Input validation seems like a good solution at first, by limiting the 
character set allowed to alphanumeric, but sometimes this approach is too 
restrictive. We might need to handle arbitrary filenames or the
code needs to run cross-platform and account for filesystem differences between
Windows, Macs and *nix.

Proposed fix:
While you could improve the string-based tests by checking for invalid 
paths (those with dot-dot etc), this approach can be risky since the 
spectrum of inputs can be infinite and attackers get really creative.

Instead, a straightforward solution is to rely on the os.path 
library to derive the base directory instead of trusting user input. 
The user input can be later appended to the safely generated base directory
so that the absolute filepath is normalized. 

Finally, add a check on the longest common subpath between the
base directory and the normalized filepath to make sure that no traversal 
is about to happen and that the final path ends up in the intended directory.
