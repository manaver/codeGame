"""
The above code is vulnerable to SQL injection because user_input is
passed unsanitized to the query logic. This makes the query logic
prone to being tampered. Consider the following input:

user_input = "Mary'); DROP TABLE Users;--"

which will result to the following query:

"INSERT INTO Users (user) VALUES ('Mary'); DROP TABLE Users;--');"

Now that you know what's wrong with the code, can you fix it?
