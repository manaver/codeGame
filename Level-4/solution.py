import sqlite3

# Vulnerable: this code will allow an attacker to insert the "DROP TABLE" SQL command into the query
# and delete all users from the database.
con = sqlite3.connect('users.db')
user_input = "Mary'); DROP TABLE Users;--"
sql_stmt = "INSERT INTO Users (user) VALUES ('" + user_input + "');"
con.executescript(sql_stmt)

# Secure through Parameterized Statements

"""
The methodology used above to protect against SQL injection is the usage of parameterized 
statements. They protect against user input tampering with the query logic 
by using '?' as user input placeholders.

In the example above, the user input, as wrong as it is, will be inserted into the database
as a new user, but the DROP TABLE command will not be executed.

code.py has 5 methods namely: 
(1) get_stock_info 
(2) get_stock_price 
(3) update_stock_price
(4) exec_multi_query
(5) exec_user_script

All methods are vulnerable! 

Some are also suffering from bad design.
We believe that methods 1, 2, and 3 have a more security-friendly design compared to methods 4 and 5.
This is because methods 4 and 5, by design, provide attackers with the chance of arbitrary script execution.

We believe that security plays an important role and methods like 4 and 5 should be avoided fully.
We, therefore, propose in our model solution to completely remove them instead of trying to secure them in their
existing form. A better approach would be to design them from the beginning, like methods 1, 2, and 3, so that
user input could be a placeholder in pre-existing logic, instead of giving users the power of directly injecting logic.

More details:
One protection available to prevent SQL injection is the use of prepared statements,
a database feature executing repeated queries. The protection stems from 
the fact that queries are no longer executed dynamically. 

The user input will be passed to a template placeholder, which means 
that even if someone manages to pass unsanitized data to a query, the injection will 
not be in position to modify the databases' query template. Therefore no SQL injection 
will occur.

Widely-used web frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and Django offer built-in protection 
to help prevent SQL injection, but that shouldn't stop you from following good practices. 
Contextually, be careful when handling user input by planning for the worst and never trusting the user.
