# Secure Code Game

_A GitHub Security Lab initiative, providing an in-repo learning experience, where learners secure intentionally vulnerable code._

<details id=0 open>
<summary><h2>Welcome</h2></summary>

- **Who is this for**: Developers, students.
- **What you'll learn**: How to spot and fix vulnerable patterns in real-world code, build security into your workflows, and understand security alerts generated against your code. 
- **What you'll build**: You will develop fixes on functional but vulnerable code.
- **Prerequisites**: In this course, you will need some knowledge of `python3` for most levels and `C` for Level 2.
- **How long**: This course is five levels long and takes 8-10 hours to complete.

## How to start this course

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
   <br />[![start-course](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/218596841-0645fe1a-4aaf-4f51-9ab3-8aa2d3fdd487.svg)](https://github.com/skills/secure-code-game/generate)
2. In the new tab, follow the prompts to create a new repository.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository ‚Äîprivate repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   ![Screenshot of the "Create a new repository" page with the "Public" repo option highlighted](/images/create-repo.png)
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
   
## üõ†Ô∏è The set up
  
#### üñ•Ô∏è Using codespaces
  
All levels are configured to run instantly with GitHub Codespaces. If you chose to use codespaces, be aware that this course **will count towards your 60 hours of monthly free allowance**. For more information about GitHub Codespaces, see the "[GitHub Codespaces overview](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview)." If you prefer to work locally, please follow the local installation guide in the next section.
  
1. To create a codespace, click the **Code** drop down button in the upper-right of your repository navigation bar.
1. Click **Create codespace on main**.
1. After creating a codespace wait for all background installations to complete. This should take less than two minutes.


#### üíª Local installation 

Please note: You don't need a local installation if you are using GitHub Codespaces.

The following local installation guide is adapted to Debian/Ubuntu and CentOS/RHEL.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Install OpenLDAP headers needed to compile `python-ldap`, depending on your Linux distribution. Check by running:
```bash
uname -a
```
 - For Debian/Ubuntu, run:
 ```bash
sudo apt-get update                                                             
sudo apt-get install libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev                                  
``` 
- For CentOS/RHEL, run: 
```bash
sudo yum install python-devel openldap-devel
```
- Then, for both Debian/Ubuntu and CentOS/RHEL, install `pyOpenSSL` by running:
```bash
pip3 install pyOpenSSL
```
3. Install the other dependencies by running:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Once installation has completed, clone your repository to your local machine.
1. From your repository, click the **Code** drop down button in the upper-right of your repository navigation bar.
1. Select the `Local` tab from the menu.
1. Copy your preferred URL.
1. In your terminal, change the working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
1. Type `git clone` and paste the copied URL.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```
6. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

For more information about cloning repositories, see "[Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)."

<summary><h2>Level 1: Black Friday</h2></summary>

_Welcome to "Secure Code Game"! :wave:_

### üìù Storyline
A few days before the massive shopping event Black Friday, an electronics shop without an online presence rushed to create a website to reach a broader customer base. As a result, they spent all their budget on development without investing in security. Do you have what it takes to fix the bug and progress to Level 2?

### :keyboard: What's in the repo?
For each level, you will find the same file structure:
- `code` includes the vulnerable code to be reviewed
- `hack` exploits the vulnerabilities in `code`. Running `hack.py` will fail initially, your goal is to get this file to pass.
- `hint` offers a hint if you get stuck.
- `solution` provides one working solution. There are several possible solutions.
- `tests` contains the unit tests that should still pass after you have implemented your fix.

### üö¶ Time to start!
1. Review the code in `code.py`. Can you spot the bug?
1. Try to fix the bug. Ensure that unit tests are still passing.
1. You successfully completed the level when both `hack.py` and `tests.py` pass üü¢.
1. If you get stuck, read the hint in the `hint.js` file.
1. Compare your solution with `solution.py`.

<summary><h2>Level 2: Matrix</h2></summary>

_You have completed Level 1: Black Friday! Welcome to Level 2: Matrix. :tada:_

### üìù Storyline
At the time "The Matrix" was first released in 1999, programming was different. In the movie, a computer programmer named Thomas "Neo" Anderson leads the fight in an underground war against powerful computers who have constructed his entire reality with a system called the Matrix. Do you have what it takes to win that war and progress to Level 3?

### üö¶ Time to start!
1. Keep working inside the same environment as in Level 1
1. If you skipped Level 1, go back and follow the üö¶ **Time to start** guide
1. Review the code in `code.h`. Can you spot the bug?
1. Try to fix the bug. Ensure that unit tests are still passing.
1. The level is completed successfully when both `hack.c` and `tests.c` pass. üü¢
1. If you get stuck, read the hint in the `hint.txt` file.
1. Compare your solution with `solution.c`.

<summary><h2>Level 3: Social Network</h2></summary>

_Nice work finishing Level 2: Matrix! It's now time for Level 3: Social Network. :sparkles:_

### üìù Storyline
The following fictitious story takes place in the mid-2030s. Authorities worldwide have become more digitized. Various governments are adapting social network technology to fight crime. The goal is to establish local communities that foster collaboration by supporting citizens with government-related questions. Other features include profile pictures, hashtags, real-time support in comments, and public tip sharing. Do you have what it takes to secure the social network and progress to Level 4?

### :keyboard: Setup instructions
- For Levels 3-5, we encourage you to enable code scanning with CodeQL. For more information about CodeQL, see "[About CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/about-codeql/)." For instructions setting up code scanning, see "[Setting up code scanning using starter workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository#setting-up-code-scanning-using-starter-workflows)."

### üö¶ Time to start!
1. The codebase generates several code scanning alerts. Your goal is to resolve these alerts for each level.
1. Review the code in `code.py`. Can you spot the bugs?
1. If you get stuck, read the code scanning alert.
1. Try to fix the bug. Make your changes and open a pull request to `main` or push your fix to a branch.
1. Check the tests and the code scanning results to confirm the alert for this level has now disappeared.

_Nicely done! Level 3: Social Network is complete. It's time for Level 4: Database. :partying_face:_

### üìù Storyline
Databases are essential for our applications. However, malicious actors only need one entry point to exploit a database, so defenders must continuously protect all entry points. Can you secure them all?

<summary><h2>Level 5: Locanda</h2></summary>

_Almost there! One level to go! :heart:_

### üìù Storyline
It's a common myth that passwords should be complex. In reality, it's more important that passwords are long. Some people choose phrases as their passwords. Users should avoid common expressions from movies, books, or songs to safeguard against dictionary attacks. Your password may be strong, but for this exercise, a website you have registered with has made a fatal but quite common mistake. Can you spot and fix the bug? Good luck!
